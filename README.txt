Program that determines the best hand in Black Jack

  # Calculate the best score for the given hand in Blackjack. Each card
  # is worth a certain amount of points:
  #
  # * A face card (K, Q, or J) is worth 10 points.
  # * Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever yields the score
  #   closest to 21 without exceeding it.
  # * All of the cards are worth their numeric value (2-10).
  #
  # `hand` contains an array of cards. Each card is represented
  # as a string combining the value and the suit.
  #
  # e.g. ["A♠", "2♥", "J♣", "10♦"]
